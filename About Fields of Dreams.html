					  <p>Welcome to Field of Real Dreams, a family owned and operated farm dedicated to sustainable <br>
					   agriculture and community engagement. Our story began in 2022, when Ts'eliso Mphakha and I<br>
					   (Thato Lehlotha) decided to pursue a dream of owning a farm. With hard work and dedication,we<br>
					   transformed a small plot of land into a thriving organic farm that is now a beloved part<br>
			           of the community.We saw a need in our community for fresh,local produce, and we wanted to do<br>
					   our part to make healthy food more accessible. We also believe that supporting local farmer<br>
		               is important for thr health of the community and our environment. We wanted to offer our <br>
					   community and neighbors fresh,delicious produce that was grown right here in our community.<br>
					   Thats why we strated "Fields of Real Dreams", with the goal of providing the freshest,<br>
				       most delicious produce to friends ans neighbors. </p>
